AgriSatAI is a groundbreaking project developed as part of the **EPICS** initiative, leveraging **AI technologies and ISRO's NRSC Satellite data** to transform agriculture and irrigation systems. By integrating machine learning algorithms with satellite imagery, AgriSatAI optimizes water usage, monitors crop health, and predicts yields, advancing sustainable farming practices.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Satellite Imagery**: Utilizes ISRO's NRSC satellite data to monitor agricultural fields.
- **AI-Driven Crop Monitoring**: Detects crop health issues through satellite imagery and vegetation indices.
- **Water Optimization**: Recommends irrigation schedules based on soil moisture and weather data.
- **Yield Prediction**: Forecasts crop yields using historical and real-time data to assist in planning and resource management.
- **Sustainability Impact**: Enhances water efficiency, reduces resource waste, and increases crop productivity.

---

## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Real-time satellite imagery from ISRO's NRSC is collected, focusing on soil moisture, crop growth patterns, and environmental conditions.

### 2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
   - **Crop Health Monitoring**: AI models analyze vegetation indices (such as NDVI) to detect crop stress and recommend interventions.
   - **Water Usage Optimization**: The system uses AI to suggest irrigation schedules based on environmental data.
   - **Yield Prediction**: Machine learning models forecast crop yields for better decision-making.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - Results are presented in an interactive dashboard, providing insights such as:
     - Areas needing irrigation or fertilizer.
     - Real-time crop health reports.
     - Yield predictions.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Optimize Water Use**: Improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water wastage.
- **Enhance Crop Health Monitoring**: Enable early detection of crop diseases and stress.
- **Accurate Yield Forecasting**: Provide farmers with reliable yield predictions to improve planning and resources.
- **Promote Sustainable Agriculture**: Implement eco-friendly farming practices through AI and satellite data.
